# QRRR
QRRR is a project for expanding the data capacity of QR codes by animating
them. A standard QR code is a static image that is capable of storing limited
amounts of data (probably for good reason). QRRR codes abandon anything
reasonable and animate QR codes to be able to significantly increate the data
capacity of a regular QR code.
