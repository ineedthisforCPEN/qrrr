# QRRR
QRRR is an animated QR code. Why? Because I thought it would be interesting to
extend a QR code's data encoding capabilities into a third dimension. A standard
[QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) is a two-dimensional image that
stores limited amounts of data (maximum of around 3000 bytes), and this is
likely done for good reasons and decided by compentent engineers. QRRR codes
abandon all good design decitions and responsibility and animate QR codes so
that they can encode unlimited amounts of data.
